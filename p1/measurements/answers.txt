2)    Predicted throughput: 18.8Mbits/sec
      Predicted latency: 125.743ms
      Actual throughput: 18.7 Mbits/sec 
      Actual latency: 123.213ms
      Explanation of results:  Results are coherent with the prediction.

3.1)  Predicted throughput: 9.35Mbits/sec
      Predicted latency: 125.743ms
      Actual throughput: 9.50 Mbits/sec and 9.82 Mbits/sec
      Actual latency: 125.725ms
      Explanation of results: Results are coherent with the prediction, the throughput its equally splitted between the two connections.

3.2)  Predicted throughput: 6.36Mbits/s
      Predicted latency: 125.743ms
      Actual throughput: 8.42 Mbits/sec and 6.11 Mbits/sec and 4.88 Mbits/sec
      Actual latency: 124.874ms
      Explanation of results: Probably the time used in the iperf its not enough for the protocol to split equally the bandwidth between the two connections. Latency its coherent.

4)    Predicted throughput: 11.9Mbits/sec
      Predicted latency: 125.743ms and 32,413ms
      Actual throughput: 10.4 Mbits/sec and 13.5 Mbits/sec
      Actual latency: 125.539ms and 32.372ms
      Explanation of results: Probably, the communication between h3-h8 arriving before the other one to the L3 (the common link with minumum bandwidth) can take some more bandwidth (to be noticed that the average throughput its equal to the one predicted). Latency its coherent.
